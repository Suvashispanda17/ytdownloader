ðŸš€ Exciting Progress Update!

I am currently working on a project that involves downloading YouTube videos programmatically using Python and the pytube library. My goal is to enhance my skills in handling video data and improve my programming expertise.

So far, Iâ€™ve successfully set up the project, and Iâ€™m learning to manage downloads effectively. However, I've encountered a few challenges, including an HTTP Error 400: Bad Request when trying to download specific videos. Iâ€™m troubleshooting this issue to ensure smooth functionality.

If you have any tips or resources related to using pytube or similar libraries, Iâ€™d love to hear them!

Stay tuned for more updates on my learning journey!
